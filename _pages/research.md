# Research on SuperSIM

SuperSIM is designed to benchmark superconducting **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)** architectures. Our research focuses on:
- **Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) designs**
- **Cycle-accurate performance evaluation**
- **Hardware-software co-design for superconducting AI**
